Example of how to script figure creation with inkscape and python.

# Requirements

- Python 3, with following packages, all of which can be installed via `pip`:
    - [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a python-based
      workflow manager.
    - [flatten-dict](https://github.com/ianlini/flatten-dict), for easily
      flattening nested dictionaries.
